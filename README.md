## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://https://tailwindcss.com//) - For styles

### What I learned

### Continued development

The margin on the left of the 5 star reviews for some reason is not being seen/applied. Fixing that
would make the solution much more similar to the given design.
